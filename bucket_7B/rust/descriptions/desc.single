Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Performance
Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage
collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded
devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

Reliability
Rust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and
thread-safety -- and enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at
compile-time.

Productivity
Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error
messages, and top-notch tooling -- an integrated package manager and
build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type
inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.
