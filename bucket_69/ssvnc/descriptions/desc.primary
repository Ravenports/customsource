The Enhanced TightVNC Viewer package started as a project to add some
patches to the long neglected Unix TightVNC Viewer. However, now the
front-end GUI and wrapper scripts features dwarf the original.

It adds a GUI for Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix that automatically starts up
STUNNEL SSL tunnel for SSL or SSH connections to x11vnc, and then launches
the TightVNC Viewer to use the tunnel. It also enables SSL encrypted VNC
connections to any other VNC Server running an SSL tunnel, such as STUNNEL,
at their end. It can be used to perform SSH tunnelled connections to any
VNC Server as well. The tool has many additional features.

The short name for this project is "ssvnc" for SSL/SSH VNC Viewer.
