XScreenSaver is a collection of popular screen savers that has become a 
standard on Unix-like operating systems running X11. The various screen 
savers often allow parameters to be changed to allow playing with the 
effects displayed.

In addition to the actual screen savers the program also is a framework 
for blanking and locking the screen.
