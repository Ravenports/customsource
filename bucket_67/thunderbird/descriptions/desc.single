Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and
calendaring client, that's easy to set up and customize. One of the core
principles of Thunderbird is the use and promotion of open standards -
this focus is a rejection of our world of closed platforms and services
that can't communicate with each other. We want our users to have
freedom and choice in how they communicate.
