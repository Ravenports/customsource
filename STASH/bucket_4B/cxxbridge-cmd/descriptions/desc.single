CXX - safe interop between Rust and C++

This library provides a safe mechanism for calling C++ code from Rust
and Rust code from C++. It carves out a regime of commonality where
Rust and C++ are semantically very similar and guides the programmer
to express their language boundary effectively within this regime.  CXX
fills in the low level stuff so that you get a safe binding, preventing
the pitfalls of doing a foreign function interface over unsafe C-style
signatures.
