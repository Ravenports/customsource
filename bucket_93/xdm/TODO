Xdm builds fine and comes up like it should when the required line is added to /etc/ttys:

  ttyv8   "/raven/bin/xdm -nodaemon"      xterm   on secure

Invalid logins are detected fine and an error message is printed. The only thing that does not work is valid logins... The login is accepted and the screen goes black for a second only to fall back to Xdm.

According to /var/log/xdm.log it hits an "IO error 35" within the X server:

--------------------
XIO:  fatal IO error 35 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server ":0"
      after 111 requests (104 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
xdm info (pid 856): Starting X server on :0
--------------------

Since there's not too much to be found about this on the net, this is probably something for a porter with a bit more X11 knowledge.
