Transmission is a cross-platform BitTorrent client that is opensource,
easy, lean, native and powerful.

This package contains the Qt GUI client.

This is the only Transmission client that can act as its own self-contained
session (as the GTK+ and Mac clients do), and can also connect to a remote
session (as the web client and transmission-remote terminal client do).
