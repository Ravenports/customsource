WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and JavaScript 
code began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE. As part of 
KDE framework KHTML was based on Qt but during their porting efforts 
Apple's engineers made WebKit toolkit independent. QtWebKit is a project 
aiming at porting this fabulous engine back to Qt.

QtWebKit was part of the Qt project before being deprecated in favor of 
the Chromium-based (and far less portable) QtWebEngine. Development 
continues outside of the official Qt project.
