The ravensw program is the package management tool used by Ravenports.
It handles the manipulation of both locally built and remotely available
binary packages.

It is a fork of FreeBSD's pkg program.  It behaves identically in most
cases, and documentation written for pkg is probably valid for ravensw
as well (after substituting the name).

The primary reason for changing the name is to avoid confusion with
"pkg", the package manager used by some Solaris derivatives.
