This sub-package contains the LuaTeX engine.

LuaTex is an extended version of pdfTeX that uses Lua as an embedded 
scripting language. Like XeTeX it supports Unicode and modern fonts but
is is extremely flexible due to being scriptable. It is meant as the 
successor of Omega/Aleph (from which it inherited some features like 
multi-directional typesetting) and pdfTeX.
