This sub-package contains the Xindy package.

Xindy is a flexible program for sorting and formatting book indexes. It 
was written as a successor of TeX's Makeindex program. In contrast to the 
latter it features good support for many languages in addition to English 
as well as many standard character encodings including Unicode.
