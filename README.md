# Custom Ravenports
Work-In-Progress Ravenports -- Used by contributers

Pull requests against [ravensource](https://github.com/jrmarino/ravensource) to add new ports or modify existing ones are great when the modifications are completely tested and working.  However, many contributers aren't experts yet.  They may have a port 80% working, but you can't create a pull request for an unfinished port.  So what does one do?

The answer is they generate a pull request against this repository.  The Ravenports developers will automatically accept the PR and then they can review and fix the work using ravenadm's custom tree functionality (option [E] in the configure menu of ravenadm).  Once the ravenport developer finishes the work, they can move it to the ravenports repository manually.
